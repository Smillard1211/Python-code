This is a more up to date version of the code of the original Discord bot I have created

With this version there is a prototype(aka beta) of the text based board game I have been working on with some other features included. some of which being using the
cog system that is present in the Discord.py library. 

Because of the new cog system some things had to be removed from the original discord bot. That being the functions of the text reader that would check the messages as I have not gotten that to work with this version. 

Some of the features that where added include:
- the board game
- some new functions(mainly for the owner)
- the owner can now use the store items
